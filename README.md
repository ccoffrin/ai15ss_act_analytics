### R Scripts for Analytics of Australian Capital Territory Open Datasets

This repository contains a collection of R scripts for analyzing the [Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Open Datasets](https://www.data.act.gov.au/). 

## Instructions

To add your own ACT analytics scripts begin by forking this repository to your personal github account, cloning it on your local machine, and adding a new directory at the root of the repository for your new script.
Inside the new directory add an R file named **analyze.r**.  This R script should only use standard R packages and pull all of the necessary data directly form the [ACT Open Datasets](https://www.data.act.gov.au/)] via an http request.  See the **cjc** directory for an example.  

Once you are happy with your R script, commit your changes to your personal fork of the repository and generate a pull request to the master repository.  When your pull request has been accepted and your new directory has been integrated into master repository, all of PDFs generated by your script will be added to one master ACT analytics collection.
